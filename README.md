Timing Analyzable Algorithmic Skeletons (TAS)
===

The TAS provide a way to efficiently implement Parallel Design Patterns (PDPs) in hard real-time embedded software. In contrast to all known other skeleton libraries, the TAS are designed with predictability and hence timing-analyzability in mind. In addition, they allow both (a) the synchronization primitives of pthreads and (b) custom synchronization idioms: Only a barrier implementation and a lock implementation are necessary.
